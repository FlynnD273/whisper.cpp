Alright so tiny.en seems fine for English isolated audio. Medium or even base seems fine if you want a multilingual model. 

There's automatic language detection built in. 

For audio with background music, it seems that the large quantised model or the non-quantised medium are the only ones that works okay, from my small-scale tests.
