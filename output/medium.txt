[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.660]   Good morning. This Tuesday is election day. After months of spirited debate and
[00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.120]   vigorous campaigning, the time has come for Americans to make important
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.760]   decisions about our nation's future. I encourage all Americans to go to the
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.460]   polls and vote. Election season brings out the spirit of competition between
[00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.400]   our political parties, and that competition is an essential part of a
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.160]   healthy democracy. But as the campaigns come to a close, Republicans,
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.280]   Democrats and independents can find common ground on at least one point. Our
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:34.500]   system of representative democracy is one of America's greatest strengths. The
[00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.520]   United States was founded on the belief that all men are created equal. Every
[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.640]   election day, millions of Americans of all races, religions and backgrounds
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.400]   step into voting booths throughout the nation. Whether they are rich or poor,
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.900]   old or young, each of them has an equal share in choosing the path that our
[00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.600]   country will take. And every ballot they cast is a reminder that our founding
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.880]   principles are alive and well. Voting is one of the great privileges of
[00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:05.040]   American citizenship, and it has always required brave defenders. As you head to
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.520]   the polls next week, remember the sacrifices that had been made by
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.440]   generations of Americans in uniform to preserve our way of life. From Bunker
[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.040]   Hill to Baghdad, the men and women of American Armed Forces have been
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.880]   devoted guardians of our democracy. All of us owe them and their families a
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.560]   special debt of gratitude on Election Day. Americans should also remember the
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.920]   important example that our elections set throughout the world. Young democracies
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.500]   from Georgia and Ukraine to Afghanistan and Iraq can look to the United States
[00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.900]   for proof that self-government can endure, and nations that still live under
[00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.820]   tyranny and oppression can find hope and inspiration in our commitment to
[00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.080]   liberty. For more than two centuries, Americans have demonstrated the ability
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.840]   of free people to choose their own leaders. Our nation has flourished
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.960]   because of its commitment to trusting the wisdom of our citizenry. In this
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.040]   year's election, we will see this tradition continue, and we will be
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.200]   reminded once again that we are blessed to live in a free nation guided by the
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.360]   will of the people. Thank you for listening.
